# Billing App

This repository contains design and implementation of 2 tasks: case study and refactor of code.

## Infrastructure

- [template.yaml](./template.yaml) The AWS resources are declared in this file.

## Script

- [tsconfig.json](./tsconfig.json) The project is written in TypeScript and the configuration is in this file.
- [webpack.config.ts](./webpack.config.ts) This file contains the configuration for webpack. Webpack helps with dependency injection, inversion of control and bundling and compiling of the source code.

## Source

- [src](./src) Contains the source-code for the billing app implementation.

### Local Requirements

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [AWS Account credentials installed on dev machine](#aws-profile-setup) (Optional)
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [DynamoDB NoSQL Workbench Setup on local machine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/workbench.settingup.install.html)

#### DynamoDB Table Setup

1. Prerequisite: DynamoDB NoSQL workbench should be installed.
2. Create a "local-docker-compose.yaml" file.
3. Copy the following snippet and save it to the `local-docker-compose.yaml`.

```
version: "3"
services:

  dynamodb:
    image: amazon/dynamodb-local
    command: -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

```

4. Run the command `docker-compose -f local-docker-compose.yaml up` in the project terminal. This will run DynamoDB in a docker container.

#### Compile Project

Run the following command to compile the project
`npm run compile`

#### Build the SAM project

```
sam build --parallel
```

#### Invoking the local lambda function

Command:

```
sam local invoke {FUNCTION_NAME}  -e {PATH/TO/EVENT/FILE} --profile {YOUR_AWS_PROFILE}
--parameter-overrides Key1=Value1 Key2=Value2 --docker-network {YOUR_NETWORK_NAME}
```

Example:

```
sam local invoke "CreateSubscriptionPlanFunction"  -e events/create-subscription-plan-event.json --profile developer
--parameter-overrides Environment=local DynamoDBEndpoint=localhost:3001 SubscriptionPlanTableName=local-subscription-plan
```

Note: profile parameter is optional.

#### Starting the API locally

Command

```
sam local start-api
```

## Deployment Strategy

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the deployment of a SAM app. The workflow is triggered whenever there is a push to the main branch of the repository. It sets up the Node.js environment, installs the necessary AWS CLI and SAM CLI tools, and then builds the SAM application using a container to ensure compatibility with the AWS Lambda runtime. The workflow deploys the application to AWS using the sam deploy command, with AWS credentials passed through GitHub Secrets.

By automating this process, the workflow ensures that any changes pushed to the main branch are consistently and reliably deployed to AWS without manual intervention. This approach uses GitHub Actions for continuous deployment by automatically handling the build and deployment steps for serverless app.

## Design Approach

### Project Structure and Design
The project is implemented as a SAM application which is running on Node.js TypeScript.
It is based on micro-services where each API is compiled and runs on its own.
It follows a Handler, Controller, Service, Repository pattern. 
This in my opinion ensures smooth development process along with loosely coupled code. 
The handler is responsible for routing to appropriate controller which is responsible for the process. 
The service class is a wrapper upon repository, which connects to the DB. The service class can also act as a processing unit whenever required for complex calculations.

The project also contains configuration files such as eslint and prettier for code formatting.

It has has setup for unit testing. Although due to time constrains, adding unit test cases was a challenge.

### Implementation

The major functionalities that were implemented are mentioned below:

1. Create subscription plans with different pricing and billing cycles.
2. Assign subscription plans to customers 
3. PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION: Generate invoices at the end of each billing cycle based on the customerâ€™s subscription plan.
4. Record payments made by customers and update invoice status accordingly.
5. Handle failed payments and implement retry logic: This was implemented with SNS/SQS pipeline.
6. Send email notifications to customers when an invoice is generated, when a payment is successful, or when a payment fails.

There are a lot of places where the code can be improved.

Please check the Swagger documentation for the API docs. Only the core APIs are implemented.
